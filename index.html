<h1>Introduction to Programing</h1>
<h4>The <em> World Wide Web </em></h4>
The <q> Web</q> is made up of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML </a> documents, 
HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Mark Up Language</em>
and is the basis for virtually every web page.  HTML documents are made up of Text Content 
(what you see), Markup (what it looks like), reference to other docs and links. 
Hyperlinks connects pages together.  The major components of the web are:
<p>1) The user/browser
<p>2) The internet
<p>3) Servers

<h4>Tags</h4>
Tags are pretty interesting, and once understood not intimidating at all, at least so far.  
Tags essentially tell our computer what to do with the contents within it.  There is typically 
an opening and closing tag. <br>There is no need to worry about remembering all tags, there 
countless resources available online that can be used to research tags.  I plan to use them!</br>
This <a href=https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3851658626/m-3847388548>video </a> explains tags in more detail.
